    <h2>Chapter 1: The Warning Signs of a Toxic Relationship</h2>
    <p>In this chapter I am going to help you recognize the warning signs of a toxic relationship, that is, those signs that tell you that you are with a man who does not suit you, does not respect you, does not value you and does not love you in a healthy way. These signs can be subtle or obvious, but in any case, you should pay attention to them and not ignore or minimize them. A toxic relationship can cause you a lot of harm and affect your physical, mental and emotional health, as well as your self-esteem, confidence and happiness. Therefore, it is important that you know how to identify them and act accordingly. - How to recognize the profile of a toxic man </p>
    <p>A toxic man is one who has a narcissistic, selfish, immature, insecure and manipulative personality. It is a man who believes he is superior to others, who needs to be in control of everything and everyone, who does not accept his mistakes or his responsibilities, who does not respect the limits or the needs of others, who has no empathy or compassion, who does not know how to communicate or express his emotions properly, who has no values or principles, who has no projects or goals, who has no friends or hobbies, who has no sense of humor or capacity for self-criticism. </p>
    <p>A toxic man can present himself in different ways and adopt different roles. He can be a charming, seductive, attentive and detailoriented man at the beginning of the relationship, and then become cold, distant, indifferent and disinterested. He can be a jealous, possessive, controlling and obsessive man, who watches you, questions you and limits you. He can be an aggressive, violent, intimidating and threatening man, who insults you, yells at you, pushes you or hits you. He can be a lying, unfaithful, disloyal and treacherous man, who deceives you, hides things from you or lies to you. He may be a victimized, dependent, insecure and needy man, who makes you feel guilty, who blackmails you emotionally or who constantly asks you for help.</p> 
    <p>These are some examples of the types of toxic men that exist. But the most important thing is that you know how to recognize their common traits: they are men who don't love you well, who don't make you feel good and who don't make you well. </p>
    <p>- How to identify abusive and manipulative behaviors</p> 
    <p>A toxic man may use different strategies to abuse and manipulate his partner. These strategies can be verbal or non-verbal, direct or indirect, conscious or unconscious. But they all have the same goal: to submit you to his will and make you lose your identity, your selfesteem and your freedom. </p>
    <p>Some of the most common abusive and manipulative behaviors are: </p>
    <p>Criticism: This consists of making negative comments about your physical appearance, your personality, your intelligence, your work, your family, your friends, your tastes, your opinions or your decisions. The goal is to make you feel inferior, insecure and dissatisfied with who you are and what you do. </p>
    <p>Contempt: This consists of showing indifference, disrespect, irony, mockery, sarcasm or insult towards you or what you care about. The goal is to make you feel devalued, humiliated and insignificant. </p>
    <p>Blame: This consists of attributing responsibility for everything bad that happens in the relationship or in his or her life. The goal is to make you feel guilty, confused and helpless. </p>
    <p>Threat: This consists of warning you of the negative consequences if you do not do what he wants or if you leave him. </p>
    <p>The goal is to make you feel fear, anguish and helplessness. </p>
    <p>Lying: This consists of hiding relevant information from you, distorting reality or inventing false stories. The goal is to make you feel distrust, doubt and disbelief.</p> 
    <p>Infidelity: This consists of having sexual or affectionate relations with other people without your consent or knowledge. The goal is to make you feel jealousy, anger and insecurity. </p>
    <p>Isolation: It consists of moving away from your family, your friends, your work, your hobbies or any other activity that you like or that is good for you. The goal is to make you feel loneliness, dependence and lack of communication.</p> 
    <p>Indifference: Consists of ignoring you, not paying attention to you, not showing you affection, not sharing with you, not supporting you or valuing you. The goal is to make you feel sadness, emptiness and dissatisfaction.</p> 
    <p>These are some of the abusive and manipulative behaviors that a toxic man can use. But the most important thing is that you know how they make you feel: bad, very bad.

      - How to assess the level of toxicity in your relationship </p>
    <p>A toxic relationship is one that does you more harm than good, that subtracts more than it adds, that takes more than it gives. A toxic relationship is one that does not allow you to be yourself, that does not respect your individuality, that does not encourage your growth, that does not enhance your happiness. A toxic relationship is one that makes you suffer more than enjoy, that makes you cry more than laugh, that makes you fear more than trust. </p>
    <p>To assess the level of toxicity in your relationship, you can ask yourself some questions such as: </p> 
    <p>Do you feel free and comfortable to express your thoughts, feelings and desires? </p>
    <p>Do you feel heard, understood and supported? </p>
    <p>Do you feel respected, valued and loved? </p>
    <p>Do you feel secure, calm and confident? </p>
    <p>Do you feel happy, excited and motivated? </p>
    <p>If most of your answers are negative, you are probably in a toxic relationship. And if you are, you should know that it's not normal, it's not healthy and it's not what you deserve. You deserve a relationship based on love, trust and mutual respect. You deserve a relationship that is good for you.</p> 
    <p>
      In this chapter you have learned to recognize the warning signs of a toxic relationship. You have seen what the profile of a toxic man looks like, what his abusive and manipulative behaviors are like and how you can assess the level of toxicity in your relationship. I hope this information has been useful and has helped you become aware of your situation. Remember that the first step in getting out of a toxic relationship is to recognize and admit it. The second step is to decide what to do about it. And the third step is to act on it. In the next chapters I will guide you through this process and give you the keys to free yourself from a toxic relationship and regain your selfesteem and happiness. Are you ready to continue? Here we go. </p>
      <p>Suggestion: </p>
      <p>Don't be fooled by appearances. A toxic man may appear very charming and caring at first, but that doesn't mean he really is. Pay attention to his actions rather than his words, and watch how he behaves with other people, especially those who have less power or authority than he does. </p>
      <p> Don't be influenced by what others say. A toxic man may have a good reputation or a good public image, but that does not mean he is a good man. Trust your intuition and your judgment, and do not ..... </p>
